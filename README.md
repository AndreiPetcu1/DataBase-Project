# DataBase Project
This project is a database-driven application designed to manage and optimize the operations of a car service center. It allows for registering clients and their vehicles, scheduling service appointments without
conflicts, tracking technical issues per vehicle along with estimated costs and deadlines, assigning mechanics based on skill and past performance, and collecting customer feedback to assess satisfaction. The system
is built on a normalized relational database structure following the 3rd Normal Form (3NF), ensuring data consistency and avoiding redundancy. Relationships between entities such as clients, vehicles, problems, and
mechanics are defined through primary and foreign keys, with constraints (like CHECK and NOT NULL) applied to guarantee valid and accurate data. This solution aims to reduce human errors, improve transparency, and
streamline resource allocation within the service center environment.
